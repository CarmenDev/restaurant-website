# Build me a restaurant... website

## Installation

Run `npm install`

## Usage

To run the live server, run `npm run serve`

## Task

I am the client. You are the web developer.

I've just commissioned you to build me a website!

Here is the mockup [desktop-mockup.png](desktop-mockup.png)

Now build!

## Rules / Hints

1) Fonts haven't been included. You will have to find fonts that closely approximate the original, but do not have to be exact. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a good place to start

2) There is no mobile design or tablet design, only desktop

3) Image assets can be found in the `/images` directory

Good luck and... don't get hungry looking at all that food!

## Bonus (Hard mode)

Create a mobile first design, and using media queries create a separate layout for tablet and desktop.
